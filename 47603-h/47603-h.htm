<h2><a name="NATURES_ORCHESTRA" id="NATURES_ORCHESTRA"></a>NATURE'S ORCHESTRA.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_a.jpg" width="58" height="70"

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">ALL nature is attuned to music.
Man may seek the fields, the
forests, the mountains, and the
meadows, to escape from
distracting noises of the city, but nowhere,
not even in the depths of mountain
forests, will he find absolute
silence. And well for him that it is so,
for should no noise, no vibration of the
air greet his accustomed ear, so appalling
would be the dead silence that he
would flee from it as from the grave.</p>

<p>Even the Bugs make music. They
may not be much as vocalists but they
take part in nature's symphony with
the brook, the Bird, and the deep diapason
of the forest monarch swaying
and humming to the gusts of the wayward
wind. It is true that the great
majority of our species of insects are
silent, and those which do make sounds,
have not true voices, breathing as they
do through holes arranged along each
side of their body, and not through
their mouths, they naturally possess no
such arrangement for making noises
connected with breathing as we find in
the human larynx.</p>

<p>The "buzzing Fly" and "droning
Bee" are classed among nature's musicians,
as well as the Cicadas, Grasshoppers,
Crickets, Locusts, Katydids,
and Beetles. Only the males are the musicians
in the insect families&mdash;with the
exception of the Mosquito, the lady being
the musical member of that family&mdash;and
the different kinds of Grasshoppers
are provided with an elaborate
musical apparatus by means of which
they call their mates.</p>

<p>Chief among the insect performers is
the Cicada, often confused with the Locust,
though he does not belong to that
family at all, who possesses a pair of
complicated kettle-drums, which he
plays with his muscles instead of sticks.</p>

<p>Directly behind the base of each hind
leg is a circular plate of about one-quarter
of an inch in diameter. Beneath
each of these is a cavity across
which is stretched a partition of three
membranes. At the top is a stiff, folded
membrane, which acts as a drum-head.
Upon this he plays with his muscles,
the vibrations being so rapid that to
the ears of some listeners the noise, or
music he engenders, sounds more like
that of a mandolin than a drum. He is
a black fellow with dull green scroll
work over his thick body, lives in
trees, and is generally invisible when
he plays the drum.</p>

<p>The Grasshopper is the fiddler of the
great orchestra, and the hotter the day
the more energetically does he fiddle.
The fellow with the short horns has a
rough hind leg which he uses as a bow;
this he draws across the wing cover,
giving off the notes which he so dearly
loves. Near the base of each fore wing
is a peculiar arrangement of veins and
cells. This arrangement differs in the
different species, but in each it is such
that by rubbing the fore wings together
they are made to vibrate, and thus,
some naturalists aver, they make the
sounds which we hear.</p>

<p>The most easily observed of all
insect musicians are the common
Crickets. By placing a sod of growing
grass in a cage with several male crickets,
you can watch them play upon
their fiddles. Upon the lower side of
their wings you will see ridges like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
those of a tiny file, and on the inner
margin toward the base from the end
of the principal vein, a hardened portion,
which may be called the scraper.
By using the files and scrapers of their
fore wings the little musicians add their
notes to the universal music of the
world. <span class="sc">Ellanora Kinsley Marble.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE BIRD is little more than a
drift of the air brought into
form by plumes; the air is in
all its quills, it breathes through
its whole frame and flesh, and glows
with air in its flying, like a blown
flame; it rests upon the air, subdues it,
surpasses it, outraces it&mdash;<i>is</i> the air,
conscious of itself, conquering itself,
ruling itself.</p>

<p>Also, into the throat of the Bird is
given the voice of the air. All that in
the wind itself is weak, wild, useless in
sweetness, is knit together in its song.
As we may imagine the wild form of
the cloud closed into the perfect form
of the Bird's wings, so the wild voice
of the cloud into its ordered and commanded
voice; unwearied, rippling
through the clear heaven in its gladness,
interpreting all intense passion
through the soft spring nights, bursting
into acclaim and rapture of choir
at daybreak, or lisping and twittering
among the boughs and hedges through
heat of day, like little winds that only
make the Cowslip bells shake, and
ruffle the petals of the Wild Rose.</p>

<p>Also, upon the plumes of the Bird
are put the colors of the air; on these
the gold of the cloud, that cannot be
gathered by any covetousness; the
rubies of the clouds, the vermilion of
the cloud-bar, and the flame of the
cloud-crest, and the snow of the cloud,
and its shadow, and the melted blue of
the deep wells of the sky&mdash;all these,
seized by the creating spirit, and woven
into films and threads of plume; with
wave on wave following and fading
along breast and throat and opened
wings, infinite as the dividing of the
foam and the sifting of the sea-sand;
even the white down of the cloud
seeming to flutter up between the
stronger plumes, seen, but too soft for
touch.&mdash;<span class="sc">Ruskin.</span></p>

<p class="drop-cap">DURING windstorms birds may
sometimes be seen flying overhead
at a great height. When
this is observable, it is said it
may be taken for granted that the
upper atmosphere is comparatively
quiet, and the disturbance is confined
chiefly to the lower regions. Many
seabirds seek the upper air of comparative
quietness during tropical hurricanes.
A writer in the Boston <i>Transcript</i>
says that when a heavy wind or
gale springs up, the Gulls, Terns and
Petrels will fly back and forth over the
water's surface, rising and falling, and
uttering their peculiar cries of warning.
If the storm extends too high up they
will drift gradually with the wind, or
fly away on the edge of the hurricane.
Very often they get caught unexpectedly
in the gales of wind, and they find
themselves in a dangerous position.
Then they struggle with might and
main against the powers of the air currents.
Knowing that danger and death
face them if they once come under the
dominion of the wind, they use all the
strength and tactics they are capable
of to combat the elements. A young
Herring Gull, a Petrel, or a Tern thus
surprised will beat up against the wind
with powerful flight. It will rise high
in the air, facing the gale, and making
a little progress forward as well as upward.
Then it will suddenly descend
with rapid flight toward one side of the
storm-swept path, but falling off at the
same time in the direction of the blowing
wind. Once more it will sweep
around and face the storm, ascending
heavenwards and striking desperately
out toward the direction of the storm.
By pursuing these tactics, the bird will
gradually work itself to one side of the
storm centre.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SLEEPING-PLACES_OF_BIRDS" id="THE_SLEEPING-PLACES_OF_BIRDS"></a>
  THE SLEEPING-PLACES OF BIRDS.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_i.jpg" width="24" height="70"

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IT IS difficult to imagine a spot with
fewer domestic features to adorn
the home than a piece of the bare
ceiling of a tropical veranda; but the
attachment of animals to their chosen
sleeping-places must rest on some preference
quite clear to their own consciousness,
though not evident to us.
In some instances the ground of choice
is intelligible. Many of the small blue
British Butterflies have grayish spotted
backs to their wings. At night they
fly regularly to sheltered corners on
the chalk downs where they live, alight
head downwards on the tops of the
grasses which there flourish, and closing
and lowering their wings as far as
possible, look exactly like seed-heads
on the grasses. If the night is cold
they creep down the stem and sleep in
shelter among the thick lower growth
of grass. The habits of birds in regard
to sleep are very unlike, some being
extremely solicitous to be in bed in
good time, while others are awake and
about all night. But among the former
the sleeping-place is the true home,
the <i>domus et penetralia</i>. It has nothing
necessarily in common with the nest,
and birds, like some other animals and
many human beings, often prefer complete
isolation at this time. They want
a bedroom to themselves. Sparrows,
which appear to go to roost in companies,
and sometimes do so, after a
vast amount of talk and fuss, do not
rest cuddled up against one another,
like Starlings or Chickens, but have
private holes and corners to sleep in.
They are fond of sleeping in the sides
of straw-ricks, but each Sparrow has
its own little hollow among the straws,
just as each of a flock of sleeping
Larks makes its own "cubicle" on the
ground. A London Sparrow for two
years occupied a sleeping-home almost
as bare of furniture as the ceiling which
the East Indian Butterfly frequented.
It came every night in winter to sleep
on a narrow ledge under the portico of
a house in Onslow Square. Above was
the bare white-washed top of the portico,
there were no cosy corners, and
at eighteen inches from the Sparrow
was the gas-lit portico lamp. There
every evening it slept, and guests leaving
the house seldom failed to look up
and see the little bird fast asleep in its
enormous white bedroom. Its regular
return during two winters is evidence
that it regarded this as its home; but
why did it choose this particular portico
in place of a hundred others in
the same square?&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<hr class="small" />

<p><span class="sc">Bird Courtships.</span>&mdash;When he (the
Flicker) wishes to charm his sweetheart
he mounts a very small twig near
her, so that his foreparts shall not be
hidden as he sits upright in regular
Woodpecker attitude, and he lifts his
wings, spreads his tail, and begins to
nod right and left as he exhibits his
mustache to his charmer, and sets his
jet locket first on one side of the twig
and then the other. He may even go
so far as to turn his head half around
to show her the pretty spot on his
"back hair." In doing all this he performs
the most ludicrous antics, and
has the silliest of expressions of face
and voice, as if in losing his heart, as
some one phrases it, he has lost his
head also. For days after she has evidently
said yes, he keeps it up to assure
her of his devotion, and, while
sitting crosswise on a limb, a sudden
movement of hers, or even a noise
made by one passing, will set him to
nodding from side to side. To all
this she usually responds in kind.&mdash;<i>Baskett.</i></p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">A WELL-KNOWN observer, who
has spent many years in the
West, says that the Sharp-tailed
Grouse, being a bird of
the wild prairies and open woodlands,
has gradually retreated westward as
the settlements have advanced, and will
soon be a rare bird, to be looked for
only in the sand-hills and unsettled portions
of the country.</p>

<p>During the summer months this bird
inhabits the open prairies, retiring in
winter to the ravines and wooded lands,
and when the snow is deep and the
weather severe often hides and roosts
beneath the snow. This sometimes
proves the destruction of the birds, the
entrance to the roosting-place being
filled by falling snow and frozen over.</p>

<p>The Sharp-tails feed chiefly on Grasshoppers,
seeds, buds, blossoms, and
berries.</p>

<p>"When walking about on the ground
they stand high on their legs, with their
sharp-pointed tails slightly elevated,
and when flushed, rise with a whirring
sound of the wings, uttering as they go a
guttural <i>kuk-kuk-kuk</i>, and swiftly wing
themselves away in a direct course.
The birds have several cackling notes,
and the males a peculiar crowing or
low call, that in tone sounds somewhat
like the call of the Turkey. In the
early spring, as the love season approaches,
they select a mound or slight
elevation on the open prairies for a
courtship ground, where they assemble
at early dawn, the males dancing and
running about in a circle before the
females in a most ludicrous manner,
facing each other with lowering head,
raised feathers and defiant looks, crossing
and recrossing each other's paths in
a strutting, pompous way, seldom fighting,
each acting as if confident of making
the greatest display, and thus winning
the admiration of and capturing
the hen of his choice. These meetings
and dances are kept up until the hens
cease laying and begin to sit."</p>

<p>These Grouse place the nest in a
tuft of grass or under a low, stunted
bush. A hollow in the ground is
worked out to fit the body and lined
with a few blades of grass arranged in
a circular form. The hens attend
wholly to the hatching and rearing of
the young and are attentive and watchful
mothers.</p>

<p>The flesh of the Sharp-tail is lighter
in color and more highly esteemed than
that of the Prairie Hen, and the bird
is therefore hunted more industriously.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE Bat is a harmless little animal,
but I doubt if many of us
would care to have a number of
them flying around. The hotter the
climate the more Bats you will find.
As evening draws nigh, even in Italy,
Greece, and Spain, out of their nooks
and corners thousands of them fly,
fluttering over the fields, through the
gardens and streets of the town,
through houses and rooms.</p>

<p>People get used to them there, and
when awakened by the noise of their
wings will get up, chase them from the
room with a stick, and though aware
they will return again when all is quiet,
lie down again and go to sleep.</p>

<p>You would scarcely think to look at
these lively little animals that they
could be tamed and become strongly
attached to their masters, would you?
But indeed they are very intelligent
and many naturalists have made pets
of them, training them to take food
from their hands or search for it in a
glass. They will follow the one they
love all over the house, and show
themselves very amiable and sensible,
too.</p>

<p>One cold spring morning a lady with
a sympathetic heart&mdash;a true Christian
lady I should judge, since she loved all
things "both great and small"&mdash;saw a
boy tossing in the air a little animal
which she took to be a Mouse. Even
so insignificant a creature should not
be needlessly tortured, so she went at
once to its rescue. Instead of a Mouse
she found it to be a Bat, half-dead
from cold and fright. With tender
hands she placed it upon some cotton
in the bottom of a basket and set it
near the fire. Many times she peeped
into the basket and was at length delighted
to see the little creature hanging
bat-fashion on the side of the basket,
its keen, bright eyes watching
every movement. One of its feet she
found was crushed. With trembling
hands she severed the bit of skin by
which it hung, and applied some healing
salve to the wound. The poor little
creature suffered too much to taste
food, but after a few days accepted a
Fly from her hands, then a bit of meat,
after which it folded its wings to signify
it had enough.</p>

<p>The Bat at length became as tame as
a Mouse and would hang itself to any
convenient portion of its mistress'
dress; would eat whatever of animal
food she gave it, and lick milk off her
fingers. At night it would settle upon
her hair, but never went near other
members of the family; would fly about
the room, and go out of the window in
search of insects, returning in a couple
of hours, and if the window was closed
hang to the window-sill, or to the sash,
until admitted. Thus it lived for two
years, a happy, contented Bat, till one
night it flew out and never returned&mdash;a
prey probably to some White Owls
who for years had made their home
in an old belfry near by.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">BATS are so much alike, especially
those common to this country,
of which there are numerous
species known to naturalists,
that the description of one will serve
for all, with the exception of the
Vampire.</p>

<p>The sub-order of smooth-nosed Bats
is represented in this country by several
species peculiar to America. The
most common in all the Atlantic coast
states is the Red Bat, or New York
Bat, which is a busy hunter of flying
insects, which it follows so persistently
that it frequently flies into rooms in
pursuit of its favorite prey. It flies
rather slowly, but it changes the direction
of its flight very rapidly, and its
movements in the air are very graceful.
Besides this species is the Black Bat,
and several others have been observed
and described, but so far the descriptions,
according to Brehm, have been
principally technical, and little or
nothing is known of their habits, except
that no North American species
seems to be harmful, but the contrary,
as they are all insect-eaters.</p>

<p>The principal food of these Bats
consists of Butterflies, Beetles, Mosquitoes,
and the like.</p>

<p>All Bats sleep by day and fly about
by night. Most of them make their
appearance at dusk, and retire to their
hiding-places long before dawn. Some
species appear between three and five
o'clock in the afternoon and flicker
merrily about in the bright sunshine.
Each species has its own hunting-grounds
in forests, orchards, avenues,
and streets, and over stagnant or slowly
flowing water-surfaces. It is said to
be rare that they fly over open fields,
for the reason that there is no game
for them. In the South they haunt the
rice fields, where insects are numerous.
Their hunting-ground is limited,
although some large species will cover
a mile in their flight, and the Bats of
the tropics fly over much greater distances.</p>

<p>Bats are in general very much averse
to the ground, and never voluntarily
place themselves on a level surface.
Their method of walking is very curious.
First the forelegs or wings are
thrust forward, hooking the claw at its
extremity over any convenient projection,
or burying it in the ground.
By means of this hold the animals
draw themselves forward, then raising
their bodies partly off the earth advance
the hind-leg, making at the same
time a tumble forward. The process
is then repeated on the opposite side,
and thus they proceed in a strange and
unearthly fashion, tumbling and staggering
along as if their brains were
reeling.</p>

<p>It has long been known that Bats
are able to thread their way among
boughs of trees and other impediments
with an ease that seems almost beyond
the power of sight. Even utter darkness
does not apparently impede their
progress, for when shut up in a darkened
room, in which strings had been
stretched in various directions, they
still pursued their course through the
air, avoiding every obstacle with precision.
This faculty has been found
not to result from any unusual keenness
of sight, but from the exquisite
nervous system of their wings.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">NATURE, children, as you observe,
gave my family a handsome
coat. Now no bird can have
fine feathers, nor beast a fine fur
but men and women desire them for
adornment, or possibly to keep themselves
warm. So the hunters, finding it
a paying business, shoot and trap us till
places which once knew the Otter
know us no more.</p>

<p>Such gentle animals as we are, too.
No little girl or boy would care to have
a more frolicsome playmate than a
young cub Otter. He will romp with
you, and play with Dog or Cat and sit up
on his hindquarters, and whistle and do
even many quaint tricks to make you
laugh.</p>

<p>To make him happy you must have
a little pond in the yard or a large
tank, though he will run about the
yard or house most of the time with
the Dog. Feed him at first on bread
and milk, then on fish, though you can
train him to do without the latter and
eat the "leavings" from the table.</p>

<p>Such fun as we Otters that live in
the Northern part of the United States
and Canada do have in winter. No
school-boy enjoys coasting down hill
more than we do. Though we live in
the water, you may say, and are known
as the fastest-swimming quadrupeds,
yet, in spite of our short legs, we can
run over land tolerably well, too. So
we trudge along till we come to a high
hill, well covered with snow; up we
scramble to the top, lie down flat on
our smooth jackets, bend our fore feet
backward and, giving ourselves a shove
with our hind legs, down we slide head-foremost.
Such fun as it is! Not till
we get hungry or too tired to jog up
the hill any more do we give it up for
that day.</p>

<p>In summer we enjoy the same sport,
too. How? Oh, all we want is a clay-bank
with a good muddy surface, and
down we go to turn a somersault into
the water of the creek below. "Shooting
the chutes" you little people would
call it, I suppose, though we call it our
"slide."</p>

<p>Our homes are always on the banks
of a stream. We begin to burrow three
or four feet below the surface of the
water, forming a tunnel which leads to
a chamber in the bank high and dry.
That is called our den and we line it
with grass and live very comfortably.</p>

<p>Being a hunted animal our senses are
very acute. When on land we are
always on the alert and, at the approach
of danger, down we go into the water
and hide in our dens. After sunset we
go out to fish. We beat the surface of
the water with our tails and frighten
the scaly fellows so that they seek
refuge under stones or in holes in the
bank. Then we catch our Fish. For
a change we eat Crabs, Frogs, and
sometimes small birds.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IN ALL parts of temperate North
America this, the most interesting
of the Otter family, makes its
home on the banks of nearly all
streams except those from which it
has been driven by man. It is much
larger than the European Otter, has a
longer tail, and has a nasal pad between
the nostrils which is larger than
that of any other species. Though
closely allied to the common species,
it has distinctive differences which entitle
it to be classed as a separate
species. Its habits resemble those of
its cousins, but it has one peculiarity
that is noticed by naturalists who have
studied this animal, which is the habit
of sliding or coasting down hill, in
which it displays a remarkable skill.
In Canada, and other sections where
the snow is plentiful, Otters indulge
freely in this sport, and, says Godman,
"they select in winter the highest ridge
of snow they can find, scramble to the
top of it, lie on their bellies with the
forefeet bent backwards and then,
giving themselves an impulse with
their hindlegs, glide head-foremost
down the declivity, sometimes for the
distance of twenty yards. This sport
they continue, apparently with the
keenest enjoyment, until fatigue or
hunger induces them to desist."</p>

<p>The young are born in April in the
northern, and earlier in the southern
part of the Otter's range, and a litter is
composed of from one to three young
ones.</p>

<p>Authorities agree that the number
of the Otters is rapidly decreasing in
America, because of the systematic
way in which they are pursued by trappers
for the value of their fur. The
skin of the American Otter is in high
reputation and general use with furriers,
but those from Canada are said
to be more valuable than those from
the more southern sections.</p>

<p>The Otter, when taken young, is
easily tamed. Audubon had several
young Otters which he says "became
as gentle as Puppies in two or three
days. They preferred milk and boiled
corn meal, refusing fish or meat till
they were several months old." They
became so tame that they would romp
with their owner, and were very good-natured
animals.</p>

<p>Rivers whose banks are thickly
grown with forests are the favorite
home of the Otter. There, says
Brehm, it lives in subterraneous burrows,
constructed in accordance with
its tastes and mode of life. "The place
of exit is always located below the surface
of the water, usually at a depth
of about eighteen inches; a tunnel
about two yards long leads thence,
slanting upwards into a spacious chamber,
which is lined with grass and
always kept dry. Another narrow
tunnel runs from the central chamber
to the surface and aids in ventilation.
Under all circumstances the Otter has
several retreats or homes." When
the water rises, it has recourse to trees
or hollow trunks.</p>

<p>The Otter is the fastest swimming
quadruped known. In the water it
exhibits an astonishing agility, swimming
in a nearly horizontal position
with the greatest ease, diving and darting
along beneath the surface with a
speed equal, if not superior, to that of
many fishes.</p>

<p>The Otter, said an eminent naturalist,
is remarkable in every way; in its
aquatic life, as well as in its movements;
in its hunt for food and in its

<p class="drop-cap">JOHN BURROUGHS relates that a
number of years ago a friend in
England sent him a score of Skylarks
in a cage. He gave them
their liberty in a field near where he
lived. They drifted away, and he never
heard or saw them again. But one
Sunday a Scotchman from a neighboring
city called on him and declared,
with visible excitement, that on his way
along the road he had heard a Skylark.
He was not dreaming; he knew it was
a Skylark, though he had not heard one
since he had left the banks of the Doon,
a quarter of a century or more before.
The song had given him infinitely more
pleasure than it would have given to
the naturalist himself. Many years ago
some Skylarks were liberated on Long
Island, and they became established
there, and may now occasionally be
heard in certain localities. One summer
day a lover of birds journeyed out
from the city in order to observe them.
A Lark was soaring and singing in the
sky above him. An old Irishman came
along and suddenly stopped as if transfixed
to the spot. A look of mingled
delight and incredulity came into his
face. Was he indeed hearing the bird
of his youth? He took off his hat,
turning his face skyward, and with
moving lips and streaming eyes stood
a long time regarding the bird. "Ah,"
thought the student of nature, "if I
could only hear the bird as he hears
that song&mdash;with his ears!" To the man
of science it was only a bird song to be
critically compared to a score of others;
but to the other it brought back his
youth and all those long-gone days on
his native hills!</p>

  NATURE STUDY AND NATURE'S RIGHT.</h2>

<p>There is another study which should
go hand in hand with nature-work&mdash;nature's
rights, people's rights. Too
many little feet are learning to trespass;
too many little hands are learning to
steal, for that is what it really is. Children
are young and thoughtless and
love flowers. But does loving and wishing
for things which are not ours make
it right to take them? If the teacher
can develop the love of nature, can she
not develop the sense of honor also?
Cannot the moral growth and the mental
growth of the child develop together?</p>

<p>To love nature is not to ruthlessly
rob her of her treasures. Therefore in
collecting for the school-room teach
the children to use thought and care in
breaking the tender branches. They
should remember that each flower on
the fruit-tree will in time become fruit.
Mother Nature has taken time and loving
care to bring forth the leaves and
flowers. The different parts of the
flowers may be studied without sacrificing
many blossoms.</p>

<p>And the birds, why rob them of nests
or eggs? Many ways can be found for
studying nests, eggs, and birds, without
causing suffering. Nature and science
study, taught by the thoughtless teacher,
can do much harm.&mdash;<i>A. G. Bullock in
School Journal.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">GOLDEN YELLOW RUMP Is
one of the names often applied
to this most beautiful member
of the Plover family, which is
thus made conspicuous and easily recognizable.
It is found everywhere in
the United States, from the Atlantic to
the Rocky Mountains, but is rare on
the Pacific coast south of Alaska. They
are seldom found far inland, their natural
home being on the seacoast, occasionally
frequenting marshy or wet
grounds, though as a rule they prefer
the sandy beach and adjacent flats and
uplands. During migration their flight,
especially in the spring, is hurried, direct
and in the night, only stopping to
rest and feed during the day, returning,
it is said, in a more leisurely manner
and largely along the seashore. When
on the ground these birds run about
on unbended legs, the bodies in a
horizontal position and heads drawn
down. While sleeping or resting
they usually sit or stand on one leg.
Captain Houdlette of the Oceanic
Steamship Company caught a Plover
that came aboard his ship while on its
way from Alaska to Hawaii. These
birds are not web-footed, and the captain
seems to have solved the problem
as to whether they ever rest on the
water during their long flights. He says
they do. "It was during the run from
San Francisco to Honolulu that I saw
several Plovers in the water resting.
When the steamer came too near
they would rise with a few flaps
of their wings, but, being very tired,
they would soon settle back into
the water again. In its efforts to get
away one of them came on board and
it lived for some time. I always
thought the birds made a continuous
flight of over 2,000 miles, but I am now
satisfied that they rest on the waves
when tired."</p>

<p>The flight of a flock of Golden Plovers
is described by Goss as swift and
strong, sweeping over the prairies in a
compact, wavy form, at times skimming
close to the ground, then high in
the air; an everchanging, circling course,
whistling as they go; and on alighting
raising their wings until the tips nearly
touch, then slowly folding them back, a
habit which is quite common with them
as they move about the ground.</p>

<p>Plovers eat Grasshoppers, Beetles, and
many forms of insect life; small berries
are also a part of their diet.</p>

<p>Mr. Nelson, in his "Report Upon
Natural History Collections in Alaska,"
gives a full and interesting account of
their nesting-habits. He says the courtship
of this handsome bird is carried on
very quietly, and there is no demonstration
of anger or quarreling among
the rivals. When two are satisfactorily
mated they quietly go about their nesting,
after which each pair limits its
range to the immediate vicinity of its
treasures. The eggs are deposited the
latter part of May in a small depression
among the moss and dried grass of a
small knoll, and at times a slight structure
is made of dried grass. Four eggs
are laid, of a pale yellowish ground
color, with very dark, well-defined umber
brown spots scattered profusely
over the shell.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">MY LITTLE readers have heard
their elders when speaking
of the Horse, Dog, Cat, and
other dumb creatures call them the
"lower" animals. Well, so they are,
but when you have grown to be
men and women you may possibly
prefer the faithful affection and
good comradeship of one of these
lower animals to the disagreeable society
of a cold, mean, and selfish
"higher" one. Indeed, to learn how
near akin are man and beast, mentally,
not physically, men and women of
large and tender natures have given up
the greater part of their lives. Many
stories have been written concerning
the faithful love of animals for their
masters, big and little, of their marvelous
instinct and almost human cunning,
but when I tell you that animals
can be taught to count&mdash;and birds are
animals, too, you know&mdash;why, then, if
you are bright children you will wonder,
as your elders do, where instinct
ends and reason begins. However,
these animals, of which I am going to
write, may have been more than usually
intelligent and capable of learning
where others would not.</p>

<p>A few years ago a confectioner
bought a Parrot, and, though the bird
talked very plainly and volubly, the
man was not satisfied. He desired his
bird to display more cleverness than
the ordinary Parrot, so he conceived
the idea of teaching her to count.
Polly didn't take to figures at all; but,
though she listened with a great deal
of patience to what her teacher had to
say she uttered never a word. When at
length he turned away discouraged,
Polly croaked, "Shut up," and turned a
double somersault on her perch, evidently
very glad indeed that school
was over.</p>

<p>Day after day Polly had her lesson,
but count aloud she would not. Still
the confectioner didn't give up the
idea, and one day, to the bird's amazement
her teacher, at lesson time, stood
before the cage with a pan of water
and a whisk broom in his hand. Dipping
the broom in the water and flirting
the drops over her head the teacher
said, "One." Giving her time to think
the matter over, a few more drops were
sprinkled upon her head, the teacher
exclaiming, "Two," and so on in this
way till he had reached ten. This
method of instruction went on for
some time; but, though Polly came
near being drowned in several of the
lessons, she stubbornly refused to repeat
the figures after her teacher.
Arithmetic was not her forte, and the
confectioner at length gave up in despair,
very much I fancy to Miss Polly's
relief.</p>

<p>A month or more went by, when one
day, as the bird in her cage was hanging
out of doors, it suddenly began to
rain. "One," the delighted confectioner
heard Polly say, as the big drops
fell upon her head, then "two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,"
in rapid succession. But to the Parrot's
vexation the rain did not cease as
it was wont to do when taking her lesson,
and every additional drop increased
her anger. Finally she could
stand it no longer, and in her shrillest
tones shouted: "Stop it, stop it!
That's all I know, hang it, that's all I
know!"</p>

<p>The confectioner says no amount of
money can buy that bird.</p>

<p>The Crow, an eminent doctor in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
Russia says, can be taught, if you have
the patience, to count up to ten, while
a certain tribe of men in Polynesia,
"higher" animals, you know, cannot be
taught to count beyond five or six.</p>

<p>This same doctor had an intelligent
Dog which was accustomed, like other
Dogs, to bury his surplus bones in the
garden. In order to test the mental
powers of this animal the doctor one day
gave him no less than twenty-six bones,
every one of which he saw the Dog
duly bury in separate places. The next
day no food was given him at meal
time, but he was commanded by his
master to dig up the bones. This the
intelligent fellow proceeded to do, but
after uncovering ten came to a full
stop. After whining and running
about in great perplexity he finally
succeeded in unearthing nine more.
Still he seemed conscious that he had
not found the full number and kept up
the search till he had fetched to his
master the other seven.</p>

<p>I think that was too much to ask of
any Dog, don't you? Many a little boy
or girl who goes to school couldn't
count that number of bones, though
you can, of course.</p>

<p>Well, the doctor then turned his attention
to the Cat. When pussy was
good and hungry a tempting morsel of
meat was held under her nose, then
withdrawn five times in succession; the
sixth time she was permitted to secure
it. This was repeated every day, till
she got accustomed to waiting for the
presentation of the meat five times; but
upon the sixth Pussy never failed to
spring forward and seize the meat.
The doctor attempted the experiment
with a higher number, but the Cat
stuck to her first lesson and after
counting one, two, three, four, five,
six, would invariably make the spring.
Had he begun with ten Pussy might
have shown herself capable of counting
that number as well as the Crow and
the Parrot.</p>

<p>A farmer tells of a Horse which in
plowing had acquired the habit of
counting the furrows, stopping for a
rest regularly at the twentieth row.
The farmer at the end of the day used
to estimate the amount of work done,
not by counting the furrows but by
remembering how many times the
Horse had stopped to rest. The poor
animal had never been taught his figures,
and his mind did not say "one,
two, three," and so on, but all the same
he had his way of counting, and never
failed to know when he had reached
twenty.</p>

<p>Still another Horse was able to count
the mile-posts and had been trained by
its master to stop for feed when they
had covered eighteen miles of a certain
road. He always stopped after passing
the eighteenth post. To test him
they put up three false mile-posts between
the real ones, and, sure enough,
deceived by the trick, he stopped at the
eighteenth post for his oats, unaware
that he had not covered eighteen miles.</p>

<p>The doctor also observed another
Horse which was accustomed to receiving
his oats precisely at noon. Whenever
the clock struck an hour the Horse
pricked up his ears as if counting the
strokes. If he heard twelve, off he
would trot to be fed, but if a less number
he would plod on resignedly at his
work. The experiment was made of
striking twelve strokes at the wrong
time, whereupon the Horse started for
his oats though he had been fed only
an hour before.</p>

<p>All of which goes to prove that the
capacity of an animal's mind is limited,
and, so you may say, is that of the
average man.</p>

<h2><a name="BUTTERFLIES_LOVE_TO_DRINK" id="BUTTERFLIES_LOVE_TO_DRINK"></a>
  BUTTERFLIES LOVE TO DRINK.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_b.jpg" width="56" height="70"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">BUTTERFLIES have never had a
character for wisdom or foresight.
Indeed, they have been
made a type of frivolity and
now something worse is laid to their
charge. In a paper published by the
South London Entomological Society
Mr. J. W. Tutt declares that some species
are painfully addicted to drinking.
This beverage, it may be pleaded, is only
water, but it is possible to be over-absorptive
of non-alcoholics. Excess in
tea is not unknown&mdash;perhaps the great
Dr. Johnson occasionally offended in
that respect&mdash;and even the pump may
be too often visited. But the accuser
states that some Butterflies drink more
than can be required by their tissues
under any possible conditions. It
would not have been surprising if, like
some other insects, Butterflies had been
almost total abstainers, at any rate,
from water, and had contented themselves
with an occasional sip of nectar
from a flower.</p>

<p class="ac">MALES ARE THE SINNERS.</p>

<p>The excess in drinking seems to be
almost a masculine characteristic, for
the topers, he states, are the males.
They imbibe while the females are busy
laying eggs. This unequal division of
pleasure and labor is not wholly unknown
even among the highest of the
vertebrates; we have heard of cases
where the male was toping at the
"public" while the female was nursing
the children and doing the drudgery of
the household. Mr. Tutt has called
attention to a painful exhibition of depravity
which can often be observed in
an English country lane, where shallow
puddles are common, but never so well
as on one of the rough paths that wind
over the upper pastures in the Alps.
Butterflies are more abundant there than
in England, and they may be seen in
dozens absorbing the moisture from
damp patches. Most species are not
above taking a sip now and again, but
the majority may be classed as "moderate
drinkers." The greater sinners
are the smaller ones, especially the
blues, and the little Butterfly which,
from its appearance, is called the
"small copper." There they sit, glued
as it were to the mud&mdash;so besotted,
such victims to intemperance, that they
will not rise till the last moment to get
out of the way of horse or man. Some
thirty years ago Prof. Bonney in his "Alpine
Regions," described this peculiarity,
saying that "they were apparently so
stupefied that they could scarcely be
induced to take wing&mdash;in fact, they
were drunk."</p>

<p class="ac">OTHER LIQUIDS ARE LIKED.</p>

<p>If we remember rightly, the female
occasionally is overcome by the temptation
to which her mate so readily
falls a victim. But we are by no means
sure that Butterflies are drinkers of
water only. Certainly they are not
particular about its purity; they will
swallow it in a condition which would
make a sanitarian shudder; nay, we
fear that a not inconsiderable admixture
of ammoniacal salts increases the
attraction of the beverage. It is admitted
that both Moths and Butterflies
visit sugar, overripe fruit, and the like,
but it is pleaded that they do this for
food. Perhaps; but we fear this is not
the whole truth. The apologist has
forgotten that practice of entomologists
called "sugaring," which is daubing
trunks of trees and other suitable
places with a mixture of which, no
doubt, sugar is the main ingredient,
but of which the attraction is enhanced
by a little rum. Every collector knows
what a deadly lure this is, and what
treasures the dark-lantern reveals as he
goes his rounds. True, this snare is
fatal only to the Moth, because at
night the Butterfly is asleep. If he
once adopted nocturnal habits we
know where he would be found, for he
is not insensible by day to the charms
of this mixture.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">FORMERLY plentiful in the
northern United States, but now
quite rare in this country,
although not so scarce in Canada,
is the Urson, otherwise called the
Canadian Porcupine. It is the tree or
climbing species and is distinguished
from other members of the family by
its slender body and tail of greater or
less length. The Urson attains a length
of thirty-two inches, seven and one-half
of which are included in the tail.
A thick set fur, which attains a length
of four and one-half inches on the nape
of the neck and changes into sharp
spines on the under parts of the body
and the tip of the tail, clothes the animal.</p>

<p>The Canadian Porcupine is a native
of the forests of North America, ranging
as far south as Virginia and Kentucky
and as far west as the Rocky
Mountains. "The Urson," says Cartwright,
"is an accomplished climber
and probably never descends a tree in
winter, before it has entirely denuded
the upper branches of bark. It is most
partial to the tenderest roots or seedling
trees. A single Urson may ruin
hundreds of them during one winter."
Audubon states that he passed through
woods, in which all the trees had been
stripped by this animal, producing an
appearance similar to that induced when
a forest has been devastated by fire.
Elms, Poplars, and Firs furnish its favorite
food, and therefore usually suffer
more than other trees from its destructiveness.</p>

<p>The nest of this Porcupine is generally
found in holes in trees or rocky
hollows, and in it the young, usually
two, more rarely three or four in number,
are born in April or May. The
young are easily tamed. Audubon says
that one which he possessed never exhibited
anger, except when some one
tried to remove it from a tree which it
was in the habit of mounting. It had
gradually become very tame and seldom
made any use of its nails, so that
he would open its cage and afford it a
free walk in the garden. When he
called it, tempting it with a sweet potato
or an apple, it turned its head
toward him, gave him a gentle, friendly
look and then slowly hobbled up to
him, took the fruit out of his hand, sat
down on its hind legs and raised the
food to its mouth with its fore-paws.
Frequently when it would find the door
of the family room open it would enter,
approach and rub itself against a member
of the family looking up pleadingly
as if asking for some dainty. Audubon
tried in vain to arouse it to an exhibition
of anger. When a Dog came
in view matters were different. Then
it instantly assumed the defensive.
With its nose lowered, all its quills
erect, and its tail moving back and
forth, it was ready for the fray. The
Dog sprang upon the Porcupine with
open mouth. That animal seemed to
swell up in an instant to nearly double
its size, sharply watched the Dog and
at the right moment dealt it such a
well-aimed blow with its tail that the
Mastiff lost courage and set up a loud
howl of pain. His mouth, tongue, and
nose were full of Porcupine quills. He
could not close his jaws, but hurried
open-mouthed off the premises.
Although the spines were immediately
extracted, the Dog's head was terribly
swollen for several weeks afterward,
and it was months before he entirely
recovered.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE great Caspian Tern is the
largest of the family, its wings,
when extended, measuring from
fifty to fifty-five inches in length. It
is a bird of very irregular distribution,
breeding in Labrador, along the Arctic
coast, on islands in Lake Michigan, on
the coasts of Virginia, Texas, and California,
and is numerous in Australia.
Forbes found it to be more or less
common about Washoe Lake and the
Humboldt Marshes, Nevada, and the
Great Salt Lake, Utah, where it was no
doubt breeding. He says that unlike
most other Terns, particularly unlike
the almost equally large Royal Tern,
the Caspian appears to breed in isolated
pairs instead of large colonies, its nest
being found far removed from that of
any other bird, and consisting merely
of a shallow depression scooped in the
sand, in which its two eggs are laid,
with little if any lining, though a few
grass or sedge blades or other vegetable
substance are sometimes added.
It is very bold in defense of its eggs or
young, darting impetuously at the intruder,
uttering meanwhile hoarse barking
or snarling cries.</p>

<p>This elegant and graceful bird is
also known as the Imperial Tern. At
a distance it is often mistaken for the
Royal Tern, but may be distinguished
from the latter by its more robust form
and less deeply forked tail. Eggs and
young have been taken on Cobb's
Island, Virginia, in July. Dr. Merrill
observed it breeding on Padre Island,
near Fort Brown, Texas, in May.
Large numbers of this species are said
to breed on Pelican Island in the Gulf
of Mexico. The eggs vary from white
to greenish-buff, spotted and blotched
with brown and lilac of different
shades.</p>

<p>The Terns furnish abundant interest
while flying. They seem always to be
on the wing, and always hungry. Like
the Gulls, they seize their food by darting
upon it, tossing it into the air and
catching it again, without alighting.
They pick up from the surface of the
water floating objects. They swim on
the surface, rarely diving deep. They
dart also upon fish from above, and
"one plows the water in flight with a
knifelike beak in hopes of running
through a shoal of fishes."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_FLOWERING_ALMOND" id="THE_FLOWERING_ALMOND"></a>THE FLOWERING ALMOND.</h2>

<p class="ac"><span class="sc">By Emily C. Thompson.</span></p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg" width="58" height="70"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE Sweet, the Bitter, and the
Flowering Almond are all of
a kin and in this kinship
many include also the Peach
and the Nectarine. The Flowering
Almond or the dwarf Almond is a
shrub which early in the spring, in
March or April, sends forth its fair
rosy blossoms before its leaves are
sprouted. The shrub seldom exceeds
three feet in height. The leaves are
like those of the willow, only darker
and of a more shining green. It is
really a native of Calmuck Tartary but
now is used extensively in gardens because
it blooms so early and can easily
be cultivated in any dry soil.</p>

<p>The Almond tree figures in history,
mythology and poetry. In the Bible
we find four references to it: Exodus
25:33, 34; 37:19, 20; Num. 17:8; Ecc.
12:5. In this connection it is interesting
to note that Aaron's famous rod
was the shoot of an Almond tree.
Theophrastus mentions the Almond as
flourishing in Greece. Cato also tells
us that it was grown, but as a luxury,
in Italy. The rest of its history is obscure
and all we know about its cultivation
in England is that it was introduced
during the reign of Henry VIII.
Virgil in the Georgics welcomes the
Almond when covered with blossoms
as the sign of a fruitful season.</p>

<p>In ancient times everything that was
considered of any importance to the
Greeks had some connection with the
siege of Troy. The Almond tree here
fared especially well, for two stories
have come down to us in mythology
relating its connection with that wonderful
event. Demophon returning
from Troy suffered the fate of many
another Greek worthy. He was ship-wrecked
on the shores of Thrace. He
was befriended by the king and received
as a guest. While at the court
he met the beautiful daughter of his
host. Immediately he fell in love with
the charming princess, gained her love
in return, and made arrangements for
the marriage. But Demophon was
obliged to return home to settle up his
affairs before he could take upon himself
these new ties. So the youth
sailed away, but never to return. The
princess, faithful Phyllis, watched and
waited, hoping in vain for the return of
her promised lord. Her constancy was
noted even by the gods who, when she
was gradually pining away, turned her
into an Almond tree. Since then this
tree has been a sign of constancy and
hope.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">"The hope in dreams of a happier hour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent-1_5">That alights on Misery's brow,</div>
    <div class="verse">Springs out of the silvery Almond flower,</div>
    <div class="verse indent-1_5">That blooms on a leafless bough."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Another version of the same story
relieves Demophon of such gross inconstancy.
It is reported by some
that the marriage took place and not
until after the couple were happily
wedded was the hero called to Athens
by the death of his father. Day by
day the young wife watched for his return
on the shore, but he was detained
until the winter passed away and with
it his faithful bride. In the spring he
returned to find only an Almond tree
awaiting his coming. He realized what
had happened and in his despair
clasped the tree in his arms when it
burst forth into blossoms although it
was bare of leaves.</p>

<h2><a name="COLOR_PHOTOGRAPHS_AND_CONVERSATION_LESSONS"

  COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS AND CONVERSATION LESSONS.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_s.jpg" width="74" height="70"

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">SINCE Nature Study Publishing
Company, in January,
1897, put before the
teaching world the first
accurately beautiful representations,
not only of the forms of
nature but of the tints and colors also,
the brightest minds have been active
in noting the effectiveness of the color
photograph in school. Thousands of
teachers have vied with each other in
applying them in nature study with
most gratifying results.</p>

<p>An important discovery has been
made almost at the same time by
many of them. The lively interest
aroused by the bird presented, the
agreeable sensations the child experiences
in relating incidents and hearing
from his mates and teacher about
its habits, and the reminiscences of
delightful outdoor experiences, all
tend to warm the child to enthusiasm.</p>

<p>This point of warmth is the supreme
opportunity of the teacher. Instruction
given under such a glow is intensely
educative. A few minutes of
such work is worth hours of effort
where the child is but indifferently
aroused.</p>

<p>Many of the best first primary teachers
do not begin to teach reading during
the first few weeks of the child in
school. They aim, first, to establish
a bond of sympathy between themselves
and their pupils, to extend their
range of ideas, and to expand their
powers of expression. Expression is
induced and encouraged along all lines,
by words, music, drawing, color work,
and physical motions.</p>

<p>The common things of life are discussed,
experiences related, and the
imagination brought strongly into
play. Songs and recitations are given
with the actions of birds, animals, persons,
or machines, imitated joyously
by groups of children. Games calculated
to train the senses and the
memory are indulged in. The whole
nature of the child is called into play,
and perfect freedom of expression is
sought.</p>

<p>Experience shows that intelligent
training along these lines is profitable.
The time of learning reading and
spelling is somewhat deferred, and
number work is delayed, but the children
who are skilfully trained in this
way outstrip the others rapidly when
they bring their trained powers to bear
upon the things that are popularly
supposed to be the business of a school.
Superintendent Speer has shown that
pupils whose technical instruction has
been deferred for several months in
this way are found at the end of the
second year far superior to others of
equal promise, who have been put at
reading, spelling, and number work
directly.</p>

<p>To conduct a conversation lesson
requires some tact. Not tact in asking
questions, nor in "talking down"
to the level of the children. Direct
questions are of doubtful value in the
first grade. In fact, the value of the
lesson may sometimes be judged by
the absence of such questions put by
the teacher. The question mark and
the pump handle resemble each other,
and often force up perfunctory contributions,
and sometimes they merely
produce a dry sound. Children do
not care to be pumped.</p>

<p>Here are a few questions that give
the children little pleasure and less
opportunity for expression: Isn't this
a very pretty bird? Do you see
what a bright eye it has? How many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
of you have seen a bird like this?
How would you like to own him, and
have him at your house? Don't you
think, dear children, God is very good
to us to let us have such beautiful
birds in the world?</p>

<p>Any one of these questions by itself is
not harmful, but an exercise made up
of such material merely gives the class
a chance to say, "Yes, ma'am," and
raise their hands. All talk by the
teacher and no activity by the class.
With a bright smile and a winning
voice, the teacher may conduct what
appears to be a pleasant exercise with
such material, but there is little real
value in it under the best circumstances
and it should be avoided systematically.
It is unskilful, and a
waste of time and opportunity.</p>

<p>Attempts to lower one's conversation
to the level of little children are
often equally unsatisfactory. Too
much use of "Mamma bird," "baby
birdies," "clothes," "sweet," "lovely,"
"tootsy-wootsy," and "Oh, my!" is
disappointing.</p>

<p>Ordinary conversation opened with
a class in much the same style and
language as used by one adult in talking
with another is found to be the
most profitable. Introductory remarks
are generally bad, though some otherwise
excellent teachers do run on
interminably with them. To begin
directly with a common-sense statement
of real interest is best.</p>

<p>Here are a few profitable opening
statements for different exercises: One
day I found a dead mouse hanging
upon a thorn in a field. Mr. Smith
told me he heard a Flicker say, "Wake
up! Wake up! Wake up!" Willie
says his bird is fond of fruit, and I
notice that most birds that eat fruit
have beautiful, bright feathers. This
bird likes the cows, and I once saw
him light on a cow's horn.</p>

<p>Such statements open the minds of
young people where many times direct
questions close them. Questions and
regular contributions to the conversation
flow readily from members of the
class when the right opening has been
made. Do not let the class feel that
your purpose is to get language from
them. Mere talk does not educate.
Animated expression alone is valuable.</p>

<p>Have plenty of material to use if the
class seem slow to respond, and have
patience when they have more to offer
than the time will admit. Bear in
mind that a conversation lesson on
some nature subject is not a nature
lesson, but is given to induce correct
thinking, which shall come out in
good language. It may incidentally
be such a nature lesson as to satisfy
the requirements of your course of
study in that line, but if you give it
as a conversation lesson, let conversation
be the exercise.</p>

<p>Where a few in the class tend to
monopolize the time you may frequently
bring a diffident one into the
exercise by casually looking at him as
if you felt his right to be heard. It is
better not to ask him to talk, but to
make it easy for him to come into the
conversation by referring to something
he has previously done or said, or by
going near him while others talk. A
hand on his shoulder while you are
conversing with others, will sometimes
open him to expression. Sometimes
you need to refer to what Willie's
father said, or what you saw at his
house, or to something that Willie
owns and is pleased with. Many
expedients should be tried and some
time consumed in endeavoring to get
such a pupil into the conversation
instead of saying point blank, "Now,
Willie, what do you think?"</p>

<p>The matter of spoken language is
words largely. The thinking of children
is always done in words, as far as
school matters go. The thoughts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the average child are correct enough
from his standpoint, and when the
teacher represses him on his first
attempt to carry his part in the exercise,
he is hurt to such an extent that
he may never recover from it, and he
may always believe himself peculiarly
unfortunate in that he is incapable of
speaking as others do.</p>

<p>The truth is that all children are
eloquent. They talk easily, very
easily, in comparison with adults who
have been frightened out of their
natural tongues, and are forever trying
to say what they think in terms that
they do not think it in.</p>

<p>All children are sensitive concerning
their speech. Some of the keenest
hurts children experience are inflicted
by those who notice patronizingly or
critically the language they use.
Mothers are in a hurry to have them
learn English at once, and so correct
them instantly when such mistakes as
"runned," "mouses," and "me wants"
occur. The child allowed to think
in his own terms overcomes his
verbal difficulties in a short time if
associated at home with those who
speak correctly, and he is perfectly
excusable for using what we call
incorrect forms until he has acquired
the so-called correct ones.</p>

<p>There are times when the child's
mind is open to acquisition of formal
expertness in language. He will find
these times for himself and exercise
himself in forms without being driven
to it at the very times when his mind
is most active with other things which
he tries to express to us in his moments
of overflowing enthusiasm. In these
moments he should not be bothered
and confused by formal quibbling. In
his most active states intellectually he
ought not to be repressed. This applies
to the child who hears good English
at home. It also applies, with slight
modifications, to the child who hears
imperfect language at home. The
child who will eventually prove capable
of correct speech will learn to
speak the best language he hears
without direct instruction if encouraged
in it and given the respect a
growing child is entitled to receive.</p>

<p>Children learn to speak while at
play. They are active and much interested
when they are acquiring a
natural vocabulary. Much of the
vocabulary is wrong from the standpoint
of the grammar and dictionary,
and they have to unlearn it. They
have to unlearn it at school and from
the lips of pains-taking parents. One
reason it is so hard for them to learn
the correct forms is this unintelligent
way of teaching. Another is that the
incorrect conversation is heard under
circumstances favorable to retention
and reproduction; that is, when the
child is much interested and happy;
while the correct forms are given him
when he is but half aroused, or when
he is somewhat intense over another
matter, and many times the intended
instruction goes in at one ear and out
at the other. When the skill of the
teacher and the things of the school
room become so powerfully attractive
to the pupil that once hearing a new
word will fix it, once seeing a word
will make him master of it in all its
forms, then the language lesson will
not need to be given; for language,
which is as natural to man as breathing,
will flow in correct forms trippingly
from the tongue, being so
fixed in the pupil's mind from the
first that he will have nothing to
unlearn.</p>

<p>Conversation lessons are intended to
take care of some of the crudest errors
in speech before the child has committed
the indiscretion of putting
them in writing. It can be done with
so much less severity in conversation
than in a written lesson. Notice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
silently the peculiarly bad expressions
and forms of statements of the whole
class, then plan your talking lesson in
which those who are not guilty of
those errors are allowed to lead. Then
let the child whom you consider most
likely to profit by hearing correct
expression from his mates give you
the necessary statement. If he use
correct forms, let another try.</p>

<p>For instance, suppose you have a
number of pupils who are inclined to
say "The robin isn't so purty as the
bluejay." The reason for this is that
the parents of nearly all these pupils will
make the same error. If early in their
experience with you you are shocked by
their speech and let them know it, you
either lose their respect or make them
feel that they and their parents are
inferior beings with no right to speak.</p>

<p>It will take a few minutes to speak
of something else that is pretty, and
let several of your pupils who speak
the word correctly give some statements
concerning pretty things. Then
call upon one of the offenders, without
his suspecting himself to be such, and
the probability is that he will say
"pretty," as you wish. But suppose
he fail, you must not think he does so
because of dullness, for he may say
"purty" for the sole reason that his
mates are listening and he fears they
may think he is trying to "put on
style." If you pass the matter in
silence that day you will find him
bolder or more acute the next day, and
he will speak the word correctly. In
this way he will seem to himself to
be teaching himself. Self-culture will
begin in him and the credit will be
yours. Another teacher would suppress
that sort of language and compel
the boy to say the word right instanter.
But her pupils speak one language in
school and a different one in places
where they are more comfortable.</p>

<p>Aim to set the child to correcting
his own speech by his own apparent
choice. A single error is easily
repressed, but the habit of looking
after one's own speech is not easily
acquired. It is easy to make a child
feel his inferiority to you, but it is a
great thing to inspire him to do the
good and wise and elegant things which
you are capable of doing in his presence.</p>

<p>The process of unlearning words
has always been a failure with the
majority of pupils, and most of the
English speaking race are ashamed of
their inability to speak. Men most
eloquent and successful in business
conversation, who were by nature fitted
to thrill the world with tongue and
pen, have been confused and repressed
by this process till they believe themselves
vastly inferior to others because
they cannot translate their thoughts
out of the terms of the street or counting
room into the language of the
grammar school, and so they never try
to fill the large places that would have
been open to them if they could but have
learned to think in terms which may
be spoken right out without fear
of opprobrium.</p>

<p>Now since so much of our teaching
psychology and common sense have
shown to be radically wrong, let us
build up our language work on the
high plane of interest in real things,
expressing thought directly without
translation into fitter terms. Let the
thinking be done in terms suitable for
life. And use the color photograph
to insure that enthusiasm necessary to
good thinking; be guarded as to how
you deal with thoughts that come hot
from growing minds, repress never,
advise kindly, and know that by following
the natural method in language
you are not ruining the speech powers
of your best pupils, as has been done
heretofore.</p>
